# ComporgII
System Benchmark Suite

This Python project benchmarks your system's performance in four critical areas:

1. 32-bit Integer Operations
2. 64-bit Floating Point Operations
3. Memory Performance
4. Hard Drive Read/Write Performance

It is designed as part of a system benchmarking project (e.g., for a course like CSCI 202: Computer Organization II).
